# Introduction

Welcome to the ComplianceGuard API Documentation! ComplianceGuard’s API platform includes numerous endpoints to help you build your solutions.
To get started, you will first need to change the base url {base_url} on our website at `https://www.cgblockchain.com/` Next, you will need to use the endpoint 'url' i.e. `New Order == "api/v1/neworder"` The final url result should be: `https://www.cgblockchain.com/api/v1/neworder`

In this API Documentation, you will notice that each data subject contains 3 components.  The “subject name” refers to the block name, “scope” is the frequency of which a block is provided for the data subject, and “attributes” are the contents of each data subject. As the ComplianceGuard API is based on an event-driven architecture, each event will be represented by one or more data subjects based on the Lifecyle of an order.
